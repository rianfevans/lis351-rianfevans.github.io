			<ul>
				<li>I'm 21 years old and turn 22 on March 17.</li>
				<li>I'm from Wisconsin and am currently attending UW-Madison.</li>
				<li>This is my last semester. I am looking for a job right now!</li>
				<li>I love traveling especially to warm places. I would love to live abroad for a while if an opportunity was presented to me! </li>
